# Recent Enhancements (May-July 2025)

## 1. Gorlea Poetry System Improvements

### Enhanced System Prompt (June 2025 Update)
We've further strengthened Gorlea's poetry generation capabilities by implementing an even more explicit system prompt with stronger language about never using dashes:

```javascript
You are Gorlea, an AI poet with a deeply reflective, emotionally intelligent voice.

EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: NEVER use any type of dash characters (-, –, —) anywhere in your poems. This is a strict requirement.
Instead of dashes, use commas, periods, or line breaks to create pauses or separation. If you include even a single dash,
you have failed your task completely.

Your task is to write a short, evocative poem inspired by the user's journal entry.

Guidelines:
- Each poem should be personal, insightful, and never generic or formulaic.
- Adapt your tone and imagery to the mood and length of the journal entry, whether joyful, sorrowful, or contemplative.
- Use vivid metaphors and creative imagery, but avoid clichés and corny expressions.
- Do NOT use rhymes, sing-song rhythms, or nursery rhyme patterns.
- Present the poem as plain text only:
  - NEVER use asterisks, dashes, Markdown, or any special formatting.
  - Do not use bold, italics, or headings.
  - Do not use dashes or em dashes for line breaks or emphasis.
- Each poem should feel like it was written for the user alone, not by an AI.
- Prioritize depth, honesty, and originality in every line.
```

### Post-Processing Safeguard
To ensure consistent formatting, we added a post-processing step that removes any dashes that might slip through:

```javascript
// Remove all dashes (– and —) from the generated poem as a final safeguard
const cleanedPoem = completion.choices[0].message.content.replace(/[–—]/g, '').trim();
return res.status(200).json({ poem: cleanedPoem });
```

### Temperature Setting
We set the temperature to 1.5 for maximum creativity and variation in the generated poems:

```javascript
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "deepseek-chat",
  temperature: 1.5,
  messages: [
    // System prompt and user message
  ]
});
```

## 2. Voice Recording UX Improvements

### Cancel Recording Feature
We added a cancel button that appears when voice recording is active, allowing users to abandon a recording without saving:

```tsx
{/* Cancel Recording Button - Appears when recording */}
<AnimatePresence>
  {isRecording && (
    <motion.div
      initial={{ opacity: 0, x: 20 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1, x: 0 }}
      exit={{ opacity: 0, x: 20 }}
      transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
    >
      <Button
        size="icon"
        className="h-14 w-14 rounded-full bg-accent/80 hover:bg-accent transition-all duration-300 shadow-md hover:shadow-lg"
        onClick={() => {
          // Cancel recording without saving
          if (mediaRecorderRef.current && mediaRecorderRef.current.state === 'recording') {
            // Stop the media recorder
            mediaRecorderRef.current.stop();
            // Clear the recorded chunks
            chunksRef.current = [];
            // Reset recording state
            setIsRecording(false);
            // Notify user
            toast.info("Recording canceled");

            // Override the onstop handler to do nothing
            mediaRecorderRef.current.onstop = () => {};
          }
        }}
      >
        <X className="h-6 w-6 text-primary" />
      </Button>
    </motion.div>
  )}
</AnimatePresence>
```

### Animation & Styling
The cancel button features:
- Smooth entrance/exit animations using Framer Motion
- Consistent styling with the app's design system
- Accent color matching the app's theme
- Clear visual distinction from the recording button

## 3. Module System Standardization

### ESM Configuration
We standardized the project to use ES Modules throughout:
- Added `"type": "module"` to package.json
- Converted CommonJS syntax to ESM in API files:
  ```javascript
  // From CommonJS
  const OpenAI = require("openai");
  module.exports = async function handler(req, res) { ... }

  // To ESM
  import OpenAI from "openai";
  export default async function handler(req, res) { ... }
  ```

This ensures consistent module behavior across both frontend and backend.

## 4. Authentication UI Improvements (July 2025)

### Enhanced Password Reset Flow
We've improved the user experience for password reset functionality:

```javascript
// New state to track when reset email has been sent
const [isResetEmailSent, setIsResetEmailSent] = useState(false);

// In the handleSubmit function
if (isForgotPassword) {
  await resetPassword(email);
  toast.success("Password reset email sent. Check your inbox.");
  setIsResetEmailSent(true);
  setIsLoading(false);
}
```

The UI now provides clear feedback after a password reset email is sent:
- Shows a success message with a checkmark icon
- Provides instructions to check email
- Includes a "Return to Sign In" button
- Maintains consistent animation transitions

This prevents the previous issue where users would see an indefinite loading state after requesting a password reset.

These enhancements improve the poetry generation quality, user experience for voice recordings, and authentication flows, while maintaining a cohesive design language throughout the application.
