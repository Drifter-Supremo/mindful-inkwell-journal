# Progress

## What Works

- All core Memory Bank files are created and up to date.
- Project cloned, dependencies installed, and Vite + React setup verified.
- `.env` created for Firebase and OpenAI keys; `.gitignore` updated to exclude `.env`.
- Firebase configured and initialized in code; Firestore db and Firebase Auth exported.
- Firestore security rules set and published in Firebase Console.
- Firestore collection creation handled automatically in code.
- `saveEntry` function implemented to save entries with content, poem, created_at, and userId.
- `getEntries` function implemented to fetch entries for the authenticated user from Firestore.
- `EntriesList.tsx` fetches and displays only the current user's Firestore data, refreshing after new entries.
- `NewEntryModal.tsx` and `NewEntry.tsx` save entries to Firestore using the authenticated Firebase userId.
- Real voice-to-text journal entries (created via the microphone button in EntriesList) are now transcribed using OpenAI, saved to Firestore, and persist after refresh, matching manual entry persistence.
- Firebase Authentication (Google sign-in) is fully integrated and working.
- All Supabase authentication code and configuration have been removed.
- "Log Out" button added to the FilterDrawer with improved styling for visibility.
- Toast notifications repositioned to the top-right to prevent UI overlap.
- All authentication and UI/UX issues resolved.
- All phase 0, 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3, and 4.1 tasks completed and checked off in tasks.md.

## What's Left to Build

- Integrate OpenAI for poem generation (Phase 6).
- Integrate OpenAI for poem generation (Phase 6).
- Continue updating and maintaining Memory Bank files as development progresses.
- Add documentation for complex features, integrations, and testing as needed.

## Current Status

- MVP setup, Firebase integration, authentication, and Firestore data functions/UI integration are complete.
- Secure credential management in place.
- All journal entry operations are now securely scoped to the authenticated user.
- UI/UX improvements implemented for logout and toast notifications.
- Simulated voice journal entries are now persisted in Firestore and remain after refresh, matching manual entries.

## Known Issues
