# Progress

## What Works

- All core Memory Bank files are created and up to date.
- Project cloned, dependencies installed, and Vite + React setup verified.
- `.env` created for Firebase and OpenAI keys; `.gitignore` updated to exclude `.env`.
- Firebase configured and initialized in code; Firestore db and Firebase Auth exported.
- Firestore security rules set and published in Firebase Console.
- Firestore collection creation handled automatically in code.
- `saveEntry` function implemented to save entries with content, poem, created_at, and userId.
- `getEntries` function implemented to fetch entries for the authenticated user from Firestore.
- `EntriesList.tsx` fetches and displays only the current user's Firestore data, refreshing after new entries.
- `NewEntryModal.tsx` and `NewEntry.tsx` save entries to Firestore using the authenticated Firebase userId.
- Firebase Authentication (Google sign-in) is fully integrated and working.
- All Supabase authentication code and configuration have been removed.
- "Log Out" button added to the FilterDrawer with improved styling for visibility.
- Toast notifications repositioned to the top-right to prevent UI overlap.
- Placeholder voice notes are not persisted and will disappear on reload (expected until voice-to-text is implemented).
- All authentication and UI/UX issues resolved.
- All phase 0, 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 3 tasks completed and checked off in tasks.md.

## What's Left to Build

- Implement voice recording and transcription (Phase 4).
- Integrate OpenAI for speech-to-text and poem generation.
- Continue updating and maintaining Memory Bank files as development progresses.
- Add documentation for complex features, integrations, and testing as needed.

## Current Status

- MVP setup, Firebase integration, authentication, and Firestore data functions/UI integration are complete.
- Secure credential management in place.
- All journal entry operations are now securely scoped to the authenticated user.
- UI/UX improvements implemented for logout and toast notifications.
- Placeholder voice notes are not persisted until full voice-to-text is implemented.
- Ready to implement voice recording and transcription.

## Known Issues

- Placeholder voice notes are not persisted and will disappear on reload (expected).
- No other outstanding technical issues at this stage.
- Documentation will be updated as new features are implemented or changes occur.
