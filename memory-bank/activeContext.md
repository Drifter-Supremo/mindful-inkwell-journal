# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- Reconstructing the Memory Bank documentation to restore full project context.
- Initializing all required core files based on projectbrief.md and standard Memory Bank structure.

## Recent Changes

- Created productContext.md with a summary of the project's purpose, problems solved, how it should work, and user experience goals.
- Confirmed that only projectbrief.md existed; all other core files are being generated.

## Next Steps

- Create systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, and progress.md with initial content derived from projectbrief.md.
- Review and update documentation as new features are developed or changes occur.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- All Memory Bank files will be kept up to date as the project evolves.
- Documentation will be updated after significant changes or upon user request.
