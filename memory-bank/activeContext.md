# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- Firestore data functions and UI integration for journal entries are complete.
- Keeping documentation and checklist progress up to date as development continues.

## Recent Changes

- Implemented `getEntries` in `src/getEntries.ts` to fetch entries from Firestore.
- Updated `EntriesList.tsx` to display Firestore data and refresh after new entries.
- Updated `NewEntryModal.tsx` and `NewEntry.tsx` to save entries to Firestore using `saveEntry`.
- Marked all phase 2.3 tasks as complete in tasks.md.

## Next Steps

- Begin phase 3: add user authentication and secure entry saving.
- Continue updating documentation as new features are developed or changes occur.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- All credentials are managed via environment variables and excluded from version control.
- Firestore collections are created automatically on first write.
- Memory Bank documentation will be updated after each significant change or upon user request.
