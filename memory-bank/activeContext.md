# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- Completing MVP project setup and Firebase integration for the Mindful Inkwell Journal.
- Ensuring secure handling of credentials and environment variables.
- Implementing Firestore data functions for journal entries.

## Recent Changes

- Created and updated all core Memory Bank files.
- Completed phase 0 and phase 1.1 of setup (repo cloned, dependencies installed, Vite + React verified).
- Created `.env` for Firebase and OpenAI keys; updated `.gitignore` to exclude `.env`.
- Added `src/config.ts` to export Firebase config and OpenAI key from environment variables.
- Initialized Firebase and exported Firestore db in `src/firebase.ts`.
- Marked all phase 1.2 and 2.1 tasks as complete in tasks.md.
- Confirmed Firestore collection creation is handled in code.
- Implemented `saveEntry` in `src/saveEntry.ts` to save entries with content, poem, created_at, and userId.

## Next Steps

- Implement Firestore data fetching and UI integration for journal entries.
- Continue updating documentation as new features are developed or changes occur.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- All credentials are managed via environment variables and excluded from version control.
- Firestore collections are created automatically on first write.
- Memory Bank documentation will be updated after each significant change or upon user request.
