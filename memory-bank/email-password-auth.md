# Email/Password Authentication Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of email/password authentication in Gorlea's Ink, replacing the previous Google sign-in flow.

## Overview

The authentication system has been updated to use Firebase's email/password authentication instead of Google sign-in. This change provides users with a more traditional authentication experience and allows for additional features like username selection and profile picture uploads.

## Key Components

### 1. Authentication Context (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)

The AuthContext has been expanded to include methods for email/password authentication:

- `signIn(email, password)`: Signs in a user with email and password
- `signUp(email, password, username)`: Creates a new user account and sets up their profile
- `resetPassword(email)`: Sends a password reset email
- `updateUserProfile(data)`: Updates user profile information
- `uploadProfilePicture(file)`: Uploads and sets a user's profile picture

The context also maintains a `userProfile` state that contains additional user information stored in Firestore.

### 2. Authentication Page (`src/pages/Auth.tsx`)

The Auth page now provides three different views:

- **Sign In**: Email/password login form with "Forgot Password?" link
- **Sign Up**: Registration form with fields for username, email, password, and password confirmation
- **Reset Password**: Form to request a password reset email

All forms include validation using Zod and provide clear error messages.

### 3. User Profile Management

User profiles are stored in Firestore with the following structure:

```typescript
interface UserProfile {
  username: string;
  photoURL?: string;
}
```

This data is stored in the `users` collection, with documents keyed by the user's UID.

### 4. Profile Picture Upload

Users can upload profile pictures through the FilterDrawer component. The implementation:

1. Uses Firebase Storage to store images
2. Updates both the Firestore profile and Firebase Auth user record
3. Includes validation for file type and size
4. Provides visual feedback during upload

## Data Migration

For users who previously used Google sign-in, their data remains accessible in Firestore. When switching to email/password authentication, users can manually update the userId field in their Firestore entries to maintain access to their previous data. This can be done directly through the Firebase Console by editing the userId field in each entry document.

## Security Considerations

1. **Password Requirements**: Passwords must be at least 6 characters long
2. **Form Validation**: All forms include client-side validation using Zod
3. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages are provided for authentication failures
4. **Firestore Rules**: Security rules ensure users can only access their own data

## UI/UX Improvements

1. **Smooth Transitions**: Animations between authentication states using Framer Motion
2. **Loading States**: Visual feedback during authentication processes
3. **Error Messages**: Clear, inline error messages for form validation
4. **Responsive Design**: Forms work well on both desktop and mobile devices

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow

1. **Sign Up**:
   - User enters username, email, and password
   - Form validates input
   - Firebase creates user account
   - User profile is created in Firestore
   - User is automatically signed in

2. **Sign In**:
   - User enters email and password
   - Firebase authenticates credentials
   - User profile is fetched from Firestore
   - User is redirected to entries page

3. **Password Reset**:
   - User enters email address
   - Firebase sends reset email
   - User follows link in email to reset password
   - User can sign in with new password

### Profile Picture Upload

1. User clicks on avatar in FilterDrawer
2. File picker opens
3. User selects an image file
4. File is validated (type, size)
5. File is uploaded to Firebase Storage
6. Profile is updated with new image URL
7. UI updates to show new profile picture

## Testing

The authentication system has been tested for:

1. Account creation with valid credentials
2. Sign-in with valid credentials
3. Error handling for invalid credentials
4. Password reset functionality
5. Profile picture upload and display
6. Form validation for all input fields

## Future Improvements

1. **Social Sign-In Options**: Add additional sign-in methods (Google, GitHub, etc.)
2. **Email Verification**: Require email verification for new accounts
3. **Account Management**: Allow users to change email, password, and delete account
4. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Add optional 2FA for enhanced security
